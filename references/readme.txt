The present contribution includes occupant presence and behaviour data along with indoor and outdoor environmental data monitored over a period of one year (from 2013-01-01 to 2013-12-31) in an office area of around 200 square meter in a university building in Vienna. Specifically, the data set includes the following:
1. Presence at work station [0:vacant, 1:occupied]
2. Window state [0:open, 1:closed]
3. Light state [0:off, 1:on]
4. Equipment power [W]
5. Indoor air temperature [�C]
6. Indoor air relative humidity [%]
7. Global radiation [W.m-2]
8. Air temperature [�C]
9. Air relative humidity [%]
10. Wind speed [m.s-1]
11. Wind direction [degree]

Occupant behaviour data and indoor environmental data streams 
(items 1-6) are stored in 15-min time intervals. 

Outdoor environmental data streams (items 7-11) are stored in hourly intervals.
